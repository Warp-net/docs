# User Guide

## Getting Started

WarpNet is a fully peer-to-peer social network. There are no central servers, logins, or registration — 
each user runs their own autonomous node.

To get started:

1. **Go to the official releases page:**
   [https://github.com/Warp-net/warpnet/releases](https://github.com/Warp-net/warpnet/releases)

2. **Download the binary for your operating system:**

    * Windows: `warpnet.exe`
    * macOS: `warpnet-darwin`
    * Linux: `warpnet-linux`

3. **Run the executable.**
   On first launch, you'll be asked to create a username and password.

That’s it — you’re online and in control.

## Important Notes

* **Your data is stored only on your machine.** If you lose your device or delete the database folder, 
  your account cannot be recovered.
* **There is no password reset.** Your password decrypts your local storage and regenerates your private key.
* **No internet signup is required.** The node connects directly to others via the P2P network.
